Real World Projects:


1. File sorter Organizes files in your Downloads folder by type. Taught me how to work with directories and conditionals.
2. Personal expense tracker Logs your spending and saves it to a CSV. Simple but great for learning input handling and working with files.
3. Website uptime checker Pings a URL every few minutes and alerts you if it goes down. Helped me learn about requests, loops, and scheduling.
4. PDF merger Combines multiple PDF files into one. Surprisingly useful and introduced me to working with external libraries.
5. Weather app Pulls live weather data from an API. This was my first experience using APIs and handling JSON.
